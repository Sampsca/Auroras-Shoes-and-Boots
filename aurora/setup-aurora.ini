Description = Aurora's Shoes and Boots introduces more than two dozen new pairs of boots that are both useful and stylish. In addition, Aurora herself is there to add a bit of spice to Athkatlan life. She'll chat with you about nobles and commoners alike, providing exciting (if not always accurate) information about their daily lives.  You will also meet the shop's nighttime attendant, the surly gnome Tomthal, doomed to the surface by a mysterious curse, and the shop's traveling salesperson, Tomthal's cheerful sister Karaea.
